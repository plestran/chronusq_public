# 1) Try to find the basis set file in standard locations
# 2) Allocate and populate a global basis set definition
# 3) Construct a local subset (viz. CQ::Molecule) of the basis set
# 4) Construct the varios maps incolving the basis set
# 5) Renormalize the LibInt2::Shell's (this is outdated in newer Libint)
