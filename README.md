Please see doc/ChronusQUserManual.pdf for instructions on Installation
and Validation of the ChronusQ Software Package

ChronusQ uses the high-performace Libint library [1] for the evaluation of 
molecular integrals over gaussian type functions. A preconfigured copy
(uncompiled) is located in the /deps directory.
